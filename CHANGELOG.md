## [0.1.0] - 2025-05-28

### Added

- Initial release of `tablesQLite` ðŸŽ‰
- Define tables declaratively using `SQLTableInfo` and `SQLColumnInfo`.
- Support for advanced constraints: `NOT NULL`, `DEFAULT`, `CHECK`, `UNIQUE`, `PRIMARY KEY`, and `FOREIGN KEY`.
- Table-level methods for:
  - Creating SQL `CREATE TABLE` statements.
  - Parsing SQL table schema from a query string.
  - Serializing/deserializing table definitions with `.to_dict()` and `.from_sql_schema()`.
- Integration-ready design:
  - Seamlessly integrates with [`recordsQL`](https://pypi.org/project/recordsQL) for insert, update, select, delete, etc.
  - Optional `add_query_methods()` patch to inject record query methods directly into `SQLTableInfo`.

### Notes

- This version is a developer-focused initial release, aimed at enabling full control over SQLite schema generation and manipulation.
- Focuses on SQLite DDL (schema logic); DML logic is offloaded to `recordsQL`.
